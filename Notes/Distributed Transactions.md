# Distributed Transactions

#### ACID Trasactions
A - Atomic (Bundle of transactions with all or none functionality)
C - Consistent (After completion of transactions, database should be in valid state)
I - Isolated (Transactions should run independently and results of a transaction are not visible to another transaction until it is finished)
D - Durable (Once a transaction is committed, its content should be preserved in the database)
