# Intro to Distributed Systems

 - A collection of independent computers connected via a network that appears to its users as a single coherent system
 - Multiple machines with multiple autonomous components, multiple point of control and multiple point of failrues.
 - Fault tolerant
 - Highly available and scalable

## Issues with distributed systems

 - Non-reliability of network causes issues
 - Latency is an issue when communicating with different computers
 - Bandwidth is not infinite
 - Network security is a big concern
 - Topology(Configuration in which applications are deployed) keeps changing
 - Multiple administrators handling multiple points in applications creates it difficult to detect the issues
 - Data transfer costs
 - Network is not homogeneous
