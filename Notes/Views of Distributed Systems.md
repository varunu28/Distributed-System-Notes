# Three views of distributed systems

## Share State View
 - Consistent application state between multiple nodes. Like an online chess game
 - Access : READ vs WRITE
 - Consistency: Strong vs Eventual
 - Highly reliable vs over wireless network

## Object Interface View
 - Type specific interface
 - Distributed system's modularity
 - Interfaces are separate from implementation
 - Good as it gives an option to accomodate multiple clients
 - Needs high level of maintanence across multiple clients and security can be compromised across multiple points

## Integration Protocol View
